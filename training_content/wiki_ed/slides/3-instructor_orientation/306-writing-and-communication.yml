title: Writing and communication
summary:
content: |
  When something is missing or wrong on Wikipedia, it isnâ€™t as simple as filling
  in the blank or correcting the error. A student considers the available
  sources, weighs competing claims and arguments, and works to communicate the
  state of knowledge about the topic accurately and without bias. And they
  must do all this in a way that can be understood by a lay audience.

  In the Wikipedia assignment, students build communication skills by:
  * identifying an audience beyond the instructor: Wikipedia's readers
  * focusing on topics appropriate to the course and discipline
  * giving and getting feedback through peer review
  * drafting, revising, and editing their work
  * engaging in formal communication processes to share ideas publicly
  * understanding ethical standards of writing to avoid plagiarism
